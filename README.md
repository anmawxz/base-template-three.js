# base-template-threejs

this project uses Vite (pronounced like "veet") which is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

I - A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

II- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production. 

# To run this project you need to install it modules by typing the following command lines in your terminal respectively:

###    npm install

###    npm run dev

And to shutdown the server you can just press your keyboard's key "q" 


### It is not over.
